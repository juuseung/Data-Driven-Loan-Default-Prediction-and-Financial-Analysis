# Data-Driven Loan Default Prediction and Financial Analysis
Loan defaults raise significant issues in the financial sector that affect lenders, borrowers, and the
overall economic environment. It results in financial losses for lenders and impedes the financial
stability of borrowers. Moreover, loan defaults can also lead to a loss of confidence in the lending
ecosystem and can disrupt credit access for individuals and businesses. The main objective of this
project is to develop predictive models that can address these challenges by accurately predicting
key aspects of the risk of loan issuance.
